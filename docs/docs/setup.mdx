## 1. Clone

First, you need to clone the project using `git`:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:swan-io/swan-partner-frontend.git
$ cd swan-partner-frontend
```

## 2. Install dependencies

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (needed for the monorepo management).

```console
$ yarn
```

## 3. Setup hosts

Add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file (so that we're able to replicate the subdomains we'll use in production):

:::note
You might need to use `sudo` to be able to write access to the `hosts` file
:::

```txt title="/etc/hosts"
127.0.0.1 banking.swan.local
127.0.0.1 onboarding.swan.local
```

## 4. Setup HTTPS

In order to replicate the production conditions (for session cookies mostly), the local server runs in HTTPS. By default, your system will warn against a self-signed certificate, but we can use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to make the system trust it.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs defaultValue="mac">
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

With [homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```console
$ brew install mkcert
$ brew install nss # needed for Firefox
$ cd server/keys
$ mkcert -install
$ mkcert "*.swan.local"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

With [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org):

```console
$ choco install mkcert
$ cd server/keys
$ mkcert -install
$ mkcert "*.swan.local"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 5. Configure your Swan project

To configure your project, simply the following command, it will prompt you with the required values:

```console
$ yarn configure
```

This command will ask you your Swan OAuth2 Client ID and Client Secret (which you can find in [Dashboard](https://dashboard.swan.io) â†’ Developers â†’ API).

:::caution
For local development, we recommend using your Sandbox credentials.
:::

:::note
In order for the Swan OAuth2 server to recognize your environment, you'll need to add the following URL in [Dashboard](https://dashboard.swan.io) â†’ Developers â†’ API â†’ Redirect URLs:

```
https://banking.swan.local:8080/auth/callback
```

Your repository is now ready for development ðŸŽ‰
