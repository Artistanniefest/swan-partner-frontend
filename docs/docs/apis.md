# APIs

The server exposes two GraphQL API endpoints:

**POST `/api/partner`** is the Swan Partner API.
This endpoint requires the user to have an active session.

**POST `/api/unauthenticated`** is the Swan Unauthenticated API.
This is used for the onboarding process before the user had a chance to authenticate.
