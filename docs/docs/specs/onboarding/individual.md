# Individual Onboarding

On each step, clicking on **Next** should update the onboarding in the API. This helps resuming the onboarding after a page reload.

# Summary screen

The first screen shows a summary of the steps to come.

:::info ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German Account

## 4. Finalize

This step just informs the user of the authentication flow to come.

Clicking on **Finalize** checks for potential errors in the onboarding using `statusInfo`, if thereâ€™s none, it redirects to the OAuth2 server to log or enroll the user through the consent app.

The OAuth2 link must have the following query parameters:

- `identificationLevel`: containing the value provided by the onboardingâ€™s `legalRepresentativeRecommendedIdentificationLevel` to make sure the account is compliant with its country regulations
- `onboardingId`: to link the user to the created account
- `projectId`

:::caution
For security & privacy reasons, once the onboarding is finalized, **itâ€™s no longer accessible through the unauthenticated API**.
