## 4. Finalize

This step just informs the user of the authentication flow to come.

The OAuth2 link must have the following query parameters:

- `identificationLevel`: containing the value provided by the onboarding‚Äôs `legalRepresentativeRecommendedIdentificationLevel` to make sure the account is compliant with its country regulations
- `onboardingId`: to link the user to the created account
- `projectId`

:::caution
For security & privacy reasons, once the onboarding is finalized, **it‚Äôs no longer accessible through the unauthenticated API**.
