**Swan Partner Frontend** is Swan's official client for user onboarding and web banking.

- **User onboarding**: process of opening new accounts for your users that follows specific steps to meet legal requirements
- **Web banking**: banking interface where users can manage their financial needs around transactions, cards, payments, and memberships

This project contains the same code used internally at Swan to provide a white-labeled, no-code banking experience.

This project might be interesting to you if:

* You need to **bootstrap** your Swan UI quickly.
* You need to **customize** your user experience, whether with fonts and colors or by eliminating optional components.
* You'd like to **learn from Swan's reference** implementation.
